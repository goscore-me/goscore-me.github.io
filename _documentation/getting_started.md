  Welcome to goscore API! Here you’ll find up-to-date information for integrating with our data collection solution. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@goscore.me">drop us a line</a>.

  Our API is WIP and available in sandbox mode as well, so you need to <a href="mailto:support@goscore.me">contact us</a> to get your API credentials. We're working hard on making Quick start guide, which walks through your entire goscore Link integration step-by-step.
  <!-- If you’re planning to use our API in Production, take a look at our Privacy Policy. The fastest way to get your integration up and running is to use our Quickstart guide, which walks through your entire Plaid integration step-by-step. You’ll integrate Plaid Link into your site or app and then use one of our client libraries to retrieve the data you need from our API. -->
